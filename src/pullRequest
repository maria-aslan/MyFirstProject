Monday morning
you are starting to fix a new bug

Steps:

1- You need to work with latest code, that's why we need to be in the main(master) branch
2- you need to "pull" to get latest code from server to your laptop.
Now I have the latest code so I can start to work

3- create a new branch.  Git -> new branch and give a name that is meaningful and click create
so On bottom right, I should see the new branch name.

4- I'll do some changes. I'll fix the bug

5- when we finish, we will commit and push our changes to Github(Server)
6- we need create a "Pull Request"
7- Someone needs to approve my pull request so I can merge my changes.
8- As soon as we merge our changes, it will be in the main(master) branch.
